# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-Based-On-Machine-Learning-And-Genetic-Algorithms
This is an artificial intelligence college assigment that aims to apply Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection in order to improve Machine Learning (ML) model performance.

That ML model represents a multi-class classifier. The classifier acts like a Signature-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) as it takes flow IP attributes as input and spits out a label which indicates its classification (benign or one of eleven DDoS types).
